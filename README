NAME
    PPIx::IndexLines

VERSION
METHODS
  new
    Accepts either a scalar or a scalar reference. This is passed directly
    to PPI::Document::new, so the same rules as in that method apply.

    Basically, if you pass in a scalar, it will be assumed to be a filename
    and said file will be loaded.

    Otherwise, a scalar reference is assumed to be a PPI document and will
    be parsed directly.

  index_lines
    Call this method to index the lines for the new PPI::Document.

  line_type
    Call this method with a line number, it will return one of

      BEGIN CHECK UNITCHECK INIT END POD __DATA__ __END__

    or
